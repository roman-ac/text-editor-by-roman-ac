## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
    

## Mission

GIVEN a text editor web application

* WHEN I open my application in my editor

    THEN I should see a client server folder structure

* WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory

    THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

* WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal

    THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

* WHEN I run my webpack plugins

    THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

* WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application

    THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

* WHEN I open the text editor

    THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

* WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window

    THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

* WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing

    THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

* WHEN I click on the Install button

    THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

* WHEN I load my web application

    THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox

* WHEN I register a service worker

    THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

* WHEN I deploy to Heroku

    THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
